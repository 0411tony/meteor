  <p>This is default index.html for the Meteor/Cordova apps. This file should
    find the correct location of the code we load, start a webserver and
    redirect there. If it is a new app, it will point at
    Application.app/www/application, if it had a hot code push before, it will
    point at Documents/meteor/version-number/.</p>
