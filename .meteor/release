# This is a static file for test purposes.
# It simulates the npm package root as being a Meteor Project.
#
# When requiring lib/index.js (dist/index.js) in tests, that file tries to
# find out all possible Meteor project root directories based on cwd before
# returning the rules.
# To stop it from searching anywhere, the existence of this file simulates the
# npm package to be a Meteor project, so the search stops immediately.
#
# When `npm link`'ing this plugin during development, it will find this folder
# as an additional Meteor project because of that. This doesn't matter because
# all files check to which Meteor project they belong.
