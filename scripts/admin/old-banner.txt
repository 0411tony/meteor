=> Meteor 0.9.0: Announcing Isobuild, the Meteor Packaging System.

   Now you can publish your own packages and use any of the over 1800 community
   packages in your app, without needing an external tool such as Meteorite.

   This release is being downloaded in the background. It's a big change!  The
   first time you run it it, it will erase your existing Meteor installation and
   replace it with an installation of Meteor 0.9.0.  (Older versions of Meteor
   will still be automatically downloaded if you need to develop apps that use
   them.)
