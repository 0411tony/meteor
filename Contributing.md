## Contributing to Meteor Documentation

Thanks for considering contributing to Meteor documentation. We really appreciate your assistance.

The simplest way to contribute to a project is to open an issue or a pull request(PR) on the relevant GitHub issue tracker:

 - Meteor API Docs: https://github.com/meteor/docs/issues
 - Meteor Guide: https://github.com/meteor/guide/issues
 - Meteor Tutorials : https://github.com/meteor/tutorials/issues

### Pull Requests

We welcome changes both large and small. Larger changes may require some discussion and buy in from the documentation maintainers before being accepted--if you are unsure, it may be sensible to open an issue discussing the changes before making them.

### Becoming a documentation maintainer

If you make larger contributions to the above properties, you may be invited to become a community documentation maintainer. This is both a recognition of your contribution (thank you!) and the granting of commit rights on the above repositories.

With those rights you can merge the Pull Requests of others as well as commit directly to the repository (and in some cases deploy the site). So please use your discretion and be courteous.

### Current Community Maintainers:
