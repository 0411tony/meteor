<h1 id="api">The Meteor API</h1>

Your Javascript code can run in two environments: the <i>client</i>
(browser), and the <i>server</i> (a Node.js container on a server).  For
each function in this API reference, we'll indicate if the function is
available just on the client, just on the server, or *Anywhere*.

<h2 id="meteor"><span>Meteor</span></h2>

{{> api_box is_client}}
{{> api_box is_server}}
{{> api_box startup}}

On a server, the function will run as soon as the server process is
finished starting. On a client, the function will run as soon as the DOM
is ready and any `<body>` templates from your `.html` files have been
put on the screen.

    // On server startup, if the database is empty, create some initial data.
    if (Meteor.is_server) {
      Meteor.startup(function () {
        if (Rooms.find().length === 0) {
          Rooms.insert({name: "Initial room"});
        }
      });
    }

{{> api_box setTimeout}}
{{> api_box setInterval}}
{{> api_box clearTimeout}}
{{> api_box clearInterval}}

On the server, native functions like `setTimeout()` that schedule future
callbacks need to be wrapped so that they create the right thread
context for your code.  You don't have to worry about the details; just
use these equivalents instead of the native functions.

{{#warning}}
We will probably override the native server functions in a future
release, obviating the need for these wrappers.
{{/warning}}

{{> api_box publish}}

To publish data to clients, call `Meteor.publish()` on the server with
two parameters: the name of the data set, and a *publish function*
that Meteor will call each time a client subscribes to the name.

{{#warning}}
Meteor will emit a warning message if you call `Meteor.publish()` in a
project that includes the `autopublish` package.  Your publish function
will still work.
{{/warning}}

If your publish function returns a collection cursor, Meteor will watch
publish each result of that cursor and then keep the client up to date
as the cursor's results change (by running `observe()` on your cursor).
When a client unsubscribes, Meteor will unset all of the client's data
for you.

    // server: publish the rooms collection, minus secret info.
    Meteor.publish("rooms", function () {
      return Rooms.find({}, {fields: {secret_info: false}});
    });

To explicitly <i>set</i> and <i>unset</i> attributes on a client, use
these methods provided by `this` in your publish function:

Example:

    // server: publish the current size of a collection
    Meteor.publish("messages-count", function (roomId) {
      var self = this;
      var uuid = Meteor.uuid();
      var count = 0;

      handle = Room.find({room_id: roomId}).observe({
        added: function (doc, idx) {
          count++;
          self.set("messages-count", uuid, "count", count);
          self.flush();
        },
        removed: function (doc, idx) {
          count--;
          self.set("messages-count", uuid, "count", count);
          self.flush();
        }
        // don't care about moved or changed
      });

      // remove data and turn off observe when client unsubs
      self.onStop(function () {
        handle.stop();
        self.unset("messages-count", uuid, "count");
        self.flush();
      });
    });

{{> api_box subscription_set}}
{{> api_box subscription_unset}}
{{> api_box subscription_complete}}
{{> api_box subscription_flush}}

{{#warning}}
If you use observe() to watch changes to the database, be sure to call `this.flush()`
from inside your observe callbacks.  Methods that update the database
are considered finished when the observe callbacks return.
{{/warning}}

{{> api_box subscription_onStop}}
{{> api_box subscription_stop}}

{{> api_box subscribe}}

When you subscribe to a set, the client will store the attributes
published by the server in local Minimongo collections, with the same
name as the `collection` argument to `set()`.  Meteor will queue
incoming attributes until you declare the `Meteor.Collection()` on the
client with the matching collection name.

    // okay to subscribe (and possibly receive data) before declaring
    // the client collection that will hold it.  assume "allplayers"
    // publishes data from server's "players" collection.
    Meteor.subscribe("allplayers");
    ...
    // client queues incoming players documents until ...
    ...
    Players = new Meteor.Collection("players");

If more than one subscription sends overlapping attributes (same
collection name, document ID, and attribute name), Meteor will *shadow*
all but one of the values.  The value in Minimongo will be that from the
*first* subscription the client activated.  (Even if it is not the first
to send the duplicated attribute.)

When you stop a subscription, Meteor removes all the data that came from
that subscription.  If any attributes shadowed a different
subscription's data, Meteor chooses the next-highest priority
subscription.

{{#warning}}
In a future release we will give you better control over subscription
priorities.
{{/warning}}

If all of the attributes in a Minimongo document are removed, Meteor
will remove the (now empty) document.  If you want to publish empty
documents, just use a placeholder attribute.

    // Clicks.insert({exists: true});

{{> api_box autosubscribe}}

The easiest way to explain `autosubscribe()` is to show an example.

    // Subscribe to the chat messages in the current room. Automatically
    // update the subscription whenever the current room changes.
    Meteor.subscriptions(function () {
      Meteor.subscribe("chat", {room: Session.get("current-room");});
    });

`func` will be run immediately, and while it runs,
records will be kept of the subscriptions it makes
(via [`Meteor.subscribe`](#subscribe)) and the data it uses
(including calls to [`Session.get`](#get)
and [`collection.find`](#find)).

Whenever the used data changes, the subscriptions will be cancelled
and `func` will be re-run to make replacement subscriptions.

{{#warning}}
It's not necessary to call `stop` on subscriptions made
from inside `Meteor.autosubscribe`.
{{/warning}}

{{> api_box methods}}

Example:

    Meteor.methods({
      foo: function (arg1, arg2) {
        // .. do stuff ..
        if (you want to throw an error)
          throw new Meteor.Error(404, "Can't find my pants");
        return "some return value";
      }
    });

Calling `methods()` on the server defines JavaScript functions that can
be called remotely by clients.  When a client invokes a method, it sends
a message to the server to run the method, along with the parameters.
The server eventually sends back a result.

Methods are always written in synchronous style.  Their caller will not
receive a response until they return (either normally, or by throwing an
exception.) But this is not a limitation, since we have fibers on the
server, so you can set up your control flow however you want.

Calling `methods()` on the client defines *stub* functions associated
with server methods of the same name.  When a client invokes a server
method, it will run that method's stub in parallel, if one is defined.
Stubs are run for their side-effects: they are intended to *simulate*
the result of what the server's method will do, but without waiting for
the round trip delay.  On the client, the return value of a stub is
ignored.  (If a stub throws an exception, including a `Meteor.Error`
exception, that will be logged to the console.)

Inside your method invocation, <b>this</b> is bound to a method
invocation object, which provides the following:

* `is_simulation`: a boolean value, true if this invocation is a stub.
* `unblock()`: when called, allows the next method from this client to
begin running.

{{#warning}}
When authentication is available, the current user will be in
`this.user`.
{{/warning}}

{{> api_box error}}

Methods can throw any kind of exception, not just `Meteor.Error`. But
`Meteor.Error` is the only kind of error that can go across the wire. If
you throw a different exception, then it will be mapped to
`Meteor.Error(500, "Internal server error")` on the wire.

{{> api_box method_invocation_is_simulation}}

{{> api_box method_invocation_unblock}}

On the server, methods from a given client run one at a time. The N+1th
invocation from a client won't start until the Nth invocation
returns. However, you can change this by calling `this.unblock()`. This
will allow the N+1th invocation to start running in a new fiber.

{{> api_box call}}

On both the client and server, if you include a callback function as the
last argument (which can't be an argument to the method, since functions
aren't serializeable), the method will run asynchronously: it will
return nothing in particular and will not throw an execption.  When the
method is complete (which may or may not happen before `Meteor.call`
returns), the callback will be called. If an error was thrown, then
`err` will be the exception object (possibly mapped to `Meteor.Error`,
just like above.) Otherwise, the return value (possibly undefined) will
be in `result`.

    // async
    Meteor.call('foo', 1, 2, function (err, result) { ... } );

If you do not pass a callback on the server, the method invocation will
block until the method is complete.  It will eventually return the
return value of the method, or it will throw an exception if the method
threw an exception. (Possibly mapped to 500 Server Error if the
exception happened remotely and it was not a `Meteor.Error` exception.)

    // sync
    var result = Meteor.call('foo', 1, 2);

On the client, if you do not pass a callback and you are not inside a
stub, `call()` will return `undefined`, and you will have no way to get
the return value of the method. That is because the client doesn't have
fibers, so there is not actually any way it can block on the remote
execution of a method.

Finally, if you are inside a stub on the client and call another
method, the other method is not executed (no RPC is generated, nothing
"real" happens.)  If that other method has a stub, that stub stands in
for the method and is executed. The method call's return value is the
return value of the stub function.  The client has no problem executing
a stub synchronously, and that is why it's okay for the client to use
the synchronous `Meteor.call` form from inside a method body, as
described earlier.

You use this functionality all the time, because the database mutators
(`insert`, `update`, `remove`) are essentially methods. When you call
them on the client (whether from inside a method or at toplevel), you're
invoking their stub versions that update the local cache, instead of
their "real" versions that update the database (using credentials known
only to the server.)

{{> api_box apply}}

`Meteor.apply()` is just like `Meteor.call()`, but it takes a method
name and an array of arguments.

{{> api_box status}}

This method returns the status of the connection between the client and
the server. The return value is an object with the following fields:

<dl class="objdesc">
<dt><span class="name">connected</span>
  <span class="type">Boolean</span></dt>
<dd>True if currently connected to the server. If false, changes will
  be queued up until the connection is reestablished.</dd>

<dt><span class="name">status</span>
  <span class="type">String</span></dt>
<dd>Text string describing the current reconnection status. The possible
  values are "`connected`" (the connection is up and
  running), "`connecting`" (disconnected and trying to open a
  new connection), and "`waiting`" (failed to connect and
  waiting to try to reconnect).</dd>

<dt><span class="name">retry_count</span>
  <span class="type">Number</span></dt>
<dd>The number of times the client has tried to reconnect since the
  connection was lost. 0 when connected.</dd>

<dt><span class="name">retry_time</span>
  <span class="type">Number or undefined</span></dt>
<dd>The estimated time of the next reconnection attempt. To turn this
  into an interval until the next reconnection, use
  "`retry_time - (new Date()).getTime()`". This key will
  be set only when `status` is `"waiting"`.
</dd>
</dl>

Instead of using callbacks to notify you on changes, this is
a <a href="#reactivity">reactive</a> data source. You can use it in a
<a href="#templates">template</a> or <a href="#meteordeps">invalidation
context</a> to get realtime updates.

{{> api_box reconnect}}

{{> api_box connect}}

By default, every Meteor client is connected to its server.  When you
call `Meteor.subscribe`, `Meteor.status`, `Meteor.call`, and
`Meteor.apply`, you are referring to the connection back to that default server.
Your client and server can open additional connections to other Meteor
servers by calling `Meteor.connect()`, passing the URL of the
server endpoint.  `Meteor.connect` returns an object which provides:

* `subscribe`
* `methods` (to define stubs)
* `call`
* `apply`
* `status`
* `reconnect`

{{#warning}}
`Meteor.connect` is not currently implemented on the
server, so you can't call remote Meteor methods on the server today.
This will change, though: you'll be able to connect to a remote server
and do synchronous method calls, and Meteor will use
fibers to run them synchronously for you.
{{/warning}}

{{> api_box flush }}

Normally, when you make changes (like writing to the database),
their impact (like updating the DOM) is delayed until the system is
idle. This keeps things predictable &mdash; you can know that the DOM
won't go changing out from under your code as it runs. It's also one
of the things that makes Meteor fast.

`Meteor.flush()` forces all of the pending reactive updates to complete
(for example, it ensures the DOM has been updated with your recent
database changes.)  Call `flush()` to apply those pending changes
immediately. The main use for this is to make sure the DOM has been
brought up to date with your latest changes, so you can manually
manipulate it with jQuery or the like.

When you call `flush()`, any auto-updating DOM elements that are not on
the screen may be cleaned up (meaning that Meteor will stop tracking and
updating the elements, so that the browser's garbage collector can
delete them.) So, if you manually call `flush()`, you need to make sure
that any auto-updating elements that you have created with templates, or
by calling [`Meteor.ui.render`](#render), have already been inserted in
the main DOM tree.

Technically speaking, `flush()` calls the [invalidation
callbacks](#on_invalidate) on every [reactive context](#context) that
has been [invalidated](#invalidate), but hasn't yet has its callbacks
called. If the invalidation callbacks invalidate still more contexts,
flush keeps flushing until everything is totally settled. The DOM
elements are cleaned up because of logic in
[`Meteor.ui.render`](#render) that works through invalidations.

{{> api_box random}}

JavaScript's `Math.random()` returns a pseudorandom number between 0
(inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).  But the language standard doesn't
guarantee the quality of the random numbers returned.  Meteor provides
`Meteor.random()`, a good PRNG replacement.  This function uses the
[Alea](http://baagoe.org/en/wiki/Better_random_numbers_for_javascript#Alea)
algorithm to generate random numbers, seeded with the value of `new
Date()`.

    > Meteor.random()
    0.7759382962249219

{{> api_box uuid}}

`Meteor.uuid()` generates an RFC 4122 version 4 UUID.  It is built on
`Meteor.random()`.

    > Meteor.uuid()
    "0ec37060-0d1a-4ddd-b560-d886b891abba"

<h2 id="meteorcollection_header"><span>Meteor.Collection</span></h2>

Meteor stores data in *collections*.  To get started, declare a
collection with `new Meteor.Collection()`.

{{> api_box meteor_collection}}

Calling this function is analogous to declaring a model in an
traditional ORM (Object-Relation Mapper)-centric framework. It sets up a
*collection* (a storage space for records, or "documents") that can be
used to store a particular type of information, like users, posts,
scores, todo items, or whatever matters to your application.  Each
document is a JSON object.  It includes an `_id` property whose value is
unique in the collection, which Meteor will set when you first create
the document.

    // common code on client and server declares livedata-managed mongo
    // collection.
    Chatrooms = new Meteor.Collection("chatrooms");
    Messages = new Meteor.Collection("messages");

The function returns an object with methods to [`insert`](#insert)
documents in the collection, [`update`](#update) their properties, and
[`remove`](#remove) them, and to [`find`](#find) the documents in the
collection that match arbitrary criteria. The way these methods work is
compatible with the popular Mongo database API.  The same database API
works on both the client and the server (see below).

    // return array of my messages
    var my_messages = Messages.find({user_id:Session.get('my_user_id')}).fetch();

    // create a new message
    Messages.insert({text: "Hello, world!"});

    // mark my first message as "important"
    Messages.update(my_messages[0].id, {$set: {important: true}});

If you pass a `name` when you create the collection, then you are
declaring a persistent collection &mdash; one that is stored on the
server and seen by all users. Client code and server code can both
access the same collection using the same API.

Specifically, when you pass a `name`, here's what happens:

* On the server, a collection with that name is created on a backend
Mongo server. When you call methods on that collection on the server,
they translate directly into normal Mongo operations.

* On the client, a [`minimongo`](#minimongo) instance is
created. Minimongo is essentially an in-memory, non-persistent
implementation of Mongo in pure JavaScript. It serves as a local cache
that stores just the subset of the database that this client is working
with. Queries on the client ([`find`](#find)) are served directly out of
this cache, without talking to the server.

* When you write to the database on the client ([`insert`](#insert),
[`update`](#update), [`remove`](#remove)), the command is executed
immediately on the client, and, simultaneously, it's shipped up to the
server and executed there too.  The [`livedata`](#livedata) package is
responsible for this.

If you pass `null` as the `name`, then you're creating a local
collection. It's not synchronized anywhere; it's just a local scratchpad
that supports Mongo-style [`find`](#find), [`insert`](#insert),
[`update`](#update), and [`remove`](#remove) operations.  (On both the
client and the server, this scratchpad is implemented using Minimongo.)

By default, Meteor automatically publishes every document in your
collection to each connected client.  Any time a client modifies a
document, and keeps those documents up to date as they change.  To turn
this behavior off, remove the package:

    $ meteor remove autopublish

{{#warning}}
Currently the client is given full write access to the collection. They
can execute arbitrary Mongo update commands. Once we build
authentication, you will be able to limit the client's direct access to
insert, update, and remove.  We are also considering validators and
other ORM-like functionality.
{{/warning}}

    // Create a collection called Posts and put a document in it. The
    // document will be immediately visible in the local copy of the
    // collection. It will be written to the server-side database
    // a fraction of a second later, and a fraction of a second
    // after that, it will be synchronized down to any other clients
    // that are subscribed to a query that includes it (see
    // Meteor.subscribe and autopublish)
    Posts = new Meteor.Collection("posts");
    Posts.insert({title: "Hello world", body: "First post"});

    // Changes are visible immediately -- no waiting for a round trip to
    // the server.
    assert(Posts.find().count() === 1);

    // Create a temporary, local collection. It works just any other
    // collection, but it doesn't send changes to the server, and it
    // can't receive any data from subscriptions.
    Scratchpad = new Meteor.Collection;
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
      Scratchpad.insert({number: i * 2});
    assert(Scratchpad.find({number: {$lt: 9}}).count() === 5);

Collections provide nearly the same API on both the client and server.
As a result, in many cases your server methods and client stubs can be
the same shared code.

{{#warning}}
In this preview, Minimongo has some limitations:

* `$elemMatch` is not supported in selectors.
* `$pull` in modifiers can only accept certain kinds
of selectors.
* In selectors, dot notation and ordinal indexing may not work correctly.
* `$` to denote the matched array position is not
supported in modifier.
* Sort does not support subkeys (you can sort on `a`,
but not `a.b`.)
* `findAndModify`, upsert, aggregate functions, and
map/reduce aren't supported.
* The supported types are String, Number, Boolean, Array,
and Object.

All of these will be addressed in a future release. For full
Minimongo release notes, see packages/minimongo/NOTES
in the repository.
{{/warning}}

{{#warning}}
Minimongo currently doesn't have indexes. This will come soon. It's
usually not an issue, since there usually isn't that much data in
the client &mdash; it is not that common for developers to implement
indexes in their client-side models anyway.
{{/warning}}

{{> api_box find}}

`find` returns a cursor.  It does not immediately access the database or
return documents.  Cursors provide `fetch()` to return all matching
documents, `map()` and `forEach()` to iterate over all matching
documents, and `observe()` to register callbacks when the set of
matching documents changes.

{{#warning}}
Collection cursors are not query snapshots.  If the database changes
between calling `Collection.find()` and fetching the
results of the cursor, or while fetching results from the cursor,
those changes may or may not appear in the result set.  This cursor
behavior mirrors MongoDB itself.
{{/warning}}

Cursors are a reactive data source.  The first time you retrieve a
cursor's documents with `fetch()`, `map()`, or `forEach()` inside a
reactive context (eg, [`Meteor.ui.render`](#render),
[`Meteor.autosubscribe`](#autosubscribe), Meteor will register a
dependency on the underlying data.  Any change to the collection that
changes the documents in a cursor will trigger a recomputation.  To
disable this behavior, pass `{reactive: false}` as an option to
`find()`.

{{> api_box findone}}

Immediately return a single document without creating an explicit
cursor.  Equivalent to `collection.find(selector, options).fetch()[0]`.

{{> api_box cursor_foreach}}
{{> api_box cursor_map}}
{{> api_box cursor_fetch}}

To access the documents in a cursor, use one of the above
methods.  `forEach` will call a callback function with each
document in order, `map` returns an array containing the
results of applying the callback function to each document,
and `fetch` simply returns an array of the results.

Examples:

    // Print the titles of the five top-scoring posts
    var top_posts = Posts.find({}, {sort: {score: -1}, limit: 5});
    var count = 0;
    top_posts.forEach(function (post) {
      console.log("Title of post " + count + ": " + post.title);
      count += 1;
    });

{{> api_box cursor_count}}

    // Display a count of posts matching certain criteria. Automatically
    // keep it updated as the database changes.
    var frag = Meteor.ui.render(function () {
      var high_scoring = Posts.find({score: {$gt: 10}});
      return $("<p>There are " + high_scoring.length + " posts with " +
        "scores greater than 10</p>");
    });
    document.body.appendChild(frag);

When called in a reactive context, `count()` registers a dependency on
the number of matching documents.  (Updates that just change or reorder
the documents in the result set will *not* trigger a recomputation.)

{{> api_box cursor_rewind}}

To access the data in a cursor more than once, call `rewind` to reset
the cursor to its initial state.

{{> api_box cursor_observe}}

Establishes a *live query* that notifies callbacks on any change to the
query result.

`callbacks` may have the following functions as properties:

<dl class="callbacks">

{{#dtdd "added(document, before_index)"}}
Called when a new document enters the result set. It was inserted
immediately before the document currently at the
position `before_index`. Or if it was inserted at the end
of the list, `before_index` will be equal to the (prior)
length of the list.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "changed(new_document, at_index, old_document)"}}
The contents of the document at position `at_index`
changed to `new_document`, was previously `old_document`.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "moved(document, old_index, new_index)"}}
A document changed its position in the result set,
from `old_index` to `new_index`. For your
convenience, its current contents is `document`. (This will
only fire immediately after `changed`.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "removed(old_document, at_index)"}}
The document at position `at_index`, which was previously
`old_document`, is no longer in the result set.
{{/dtdd}}

</dl>

`added` will immediately be called as necessary to
deliver the initial results of the query, if any.

`observe()` returns a live query handle, which is an object with a
`stop() method.  Call this function with no arguments to stop calling
the callback functions and tear down the query. **The query will run
forever until you call this.**

Calling `observe` in a reactive context does *not* register a dependency
on the query.

Example:

    // Keep track of how many administrators are online.
    var count = 0;
    var query = Users.find({admin: true, online_now: true});
    var handle = query.observe({
      added: function (user) {
        count++;
        console.log(user.name + " brings the total to " + count + " admins.");
      },
      removed: function () {
        count--;
        console.log("Lost one. We're now down to " + count + " admins.");
      }
    });

    // After five seconds, stop keeping the count.
    setTimeout(function () {handle.stop();}, 5000);

{{> api_box insert}}

Add a document to the collection. A document is just an object, and
its fields can contain any combination of JSON-compatible datatypes
(arrays, objects, numbers, strings, null, true, and false).

`insert()` will generate a unique ID for the object you pass, insert it
in the database, and return the ID.

On the server, if you don't provide a callback, then `insert` blocks
until the database acknowledges the write, or throws an exception if
something went wrong.  If you do provide a callback, the server calls
that callback with the error and result of the insert command.

On the client, `insert` never blocks.  If you do not provide a callback
and the insert fails on the server, then Meteor will log a warning with
`Meteor._debug()`.  If you provide a callback, Meteor will call that
function with the error and result of the server's insert.

Example:

    var groceries_id = Lists.insert({name: "Groceries"})._id;
    Items.insert({list: groceries_id, name: "Watercress"});
    Items.insert({list: groceries_id, name: "Persimmons"});

{{> api_box update}}

Modify documents that match `selector` as
given by `modifer` (see <a href="#modifiers">modifier
documentation</a>).  By default, modify only one matching document.
If `multi` is true, modify all matching documents.

Instead of a selector, you can pass a string, which will be
interpreted as an `_id`.

{{#warning}}
The Mongo `upsert` feature is not implemented.
{{/warning}}

On the server, if you don't provide a callback, then `update` blocks
until the database acknowledges the write, or throws an exception if
something went wrong.  If you do provide a callback, the server calls
that callback with the error and result of the update command.

On the client, `update` never blocks.  If you do not provide a callback
and the insert fails on the server, then Meteor will log a warning with
`Meteor._debug()`.  If you provide a callback, Meteor will call that
function with the error and result of the server's update.

Example:

    // Give the "Superlative" badge to each user with a score greater than
    // 10. If they are logged in and their badge list is visible on the
    // screen, it will update automatically as they watch.
    Users.update({score: {$gt: 10}},
                 {badges: {$addToSet: "Superlative"}},
                 {multi: true});

{{> api_box remove}}

Find all of the documents that match `selector`, and
delete them from the collection. Or instead of a selector, you may
pass a string, to delete the document with that `_id`.
Without any selector, remove all documents from the collection.

On the server, if you don't provide a callback, then `remove` blocks
until the database acknowledges the write, or throws an exception if
something went wrong.  If you do provide a callback, the server calls
that callback with the error and result of the remove command.

On the client, `remove` never blocks.  If you do not provide a callback
and the insert fails on the server, then Meteor will log a warning with
`Meteor._debug()`.  If you provide a callback, Meteor will call that
function with the error and result of the server's remove.

Example:

    // Delete all users with a karma of less than -2.
    Users.remove({karma: {$lt: -2}});

    // Delete all the log entries
    Logs.remove();

    // Show a list of posts that have been flagged, updating in realtime.
    // Put a link next to each post that deletes the post if clicked.
    var frag = Meteor.renderList(Posts, {
      selector: {flagged: true},
      render: function (post) {
        // In real code it'd be necessary to sanitize post.name
        return $("<div>" + post.name +
          " <span class='delete'>Delete</span></div>");
      },
      events: {
        'click .delete': function () {
          Posts.remove(this._id);
        }
      }
    });
    document.body.appendChild(frag);

{{#api_box_inline selectors}}

In its simplest form, a selector is just a set of keys that must
match in a document:

    // Matches all documents where deleted is false
    {deleted: false}

    // Matches all documents where the name and cognomen are as given
    {name: "Rhialto", cognomen: "the Marvelous"}

    // Matches every document
    {}

But they can also contain more complicated tests:

    // Matches documents where age is greater than 18
    {age: {$gt: 18}}

    // Also matches documents where tags is an array containing "today"
    {tags: "popular"}

    // Matches documents where fruit is one of three possibilities
    {fruit: {$in: ["peach", "plum", "pear"]}}

See the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries" target="_blank">complete documentation.</a>

{{/api_box_inline}}

{{#api_box_inline modifiers}}

A modifer is an object that describes how to update a document in
place by changing some of its fields. Some examples:

    // Set the 'admin' property on the document to true
    {$set: {admin: true}}

    // Add 2 to the 'votes' property, and add "Traz" to the end of the
    // 'supporters' array
    {$inc: {votes: 2}, $push: {supporters: "Traz"}}

But if a modifier doesn't contain any $-operators, then it is
instead interpreted as a literal document, and completely replaces
whatever was previously in the database.

    // Find the document with id "123", and completely replace it.
    Users.update({_id: "123"}, {name: "Alice", friends: ["Bob"]});

See the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Updating#Updating-ModifierOperations" target="_blank">full list of modifiers.</a>

{{/api_box_inline}}

{{#api_box_inline sortspecifiers}}

Sorts may be specified using your choice of several syntaxes:

    // All of these do the same thing (sort in ascending order by
    // key "a", breaking ties in descending order of key "b")

    [["a", "asc"], ["b", "desc"]]
    ["a", ["b", "desc"]]
    {a: 1, b: -1}

The last form will only work if your JavaScript implementation
preserves the order of keys in objects. Most do, most of the time, but
it's up to you to be sure.

{{/api_box_inline}}

<h2 id="session"><span>Session</span></h2>

`Session` provides a global object on the client that you can use to
store an arbitrary set of key-value pairs. Use it to store things like
the currently selected item in a list.

What's special about `Session` is that it's reactive. If
you call [`Session.get`](#get)`("current_list")`
from inside a template, the template will automatically be rerendered
whenever [`Session.set`](#set) is called.

{{> api_box set}}

Example:

    Meteor.autosubcribe(function () {
      Meteor.subscribe("chat-history", {room: Session.get("currentRoomId")});
    });

    // Causes the function passed to Meteor.autosubscribe to be re-run, so
    // that the chat-history subscription is moved to the room "home".
    Session.set("currentRoomId", "home");

See [`Meteor.deps`](#meteordeps) for another example.

{{> api_box get}}

Example:

    Session.set("enemy", "Eastasia");
    var frag = Meteor.ui.render(function () {
      return $("<p>We've always been at war with " +
        Session.get("enemy") + "</p>");
    });

    // Page will say "We've always been at war with Eastasia"
    document.body.append(frag);

    // Page will change to say "We've always been at war with Eurasia"
    Session.set("enemy", "Eurasia");

{{> api_box equals}}

These two expressions do the same thing:

    (1) Session.get("key") === value
    (2) Session.equals("key", value)

... but the second one is always better. It triggers fewer invalidations
(template redraws), making your program more efficient.

Example:

    // Show a dynamically updating list of items. Let the user click on an
    // item to select it. The selected item is given a CSS class so it
    // can be rendered differently.
    var frag = Meteor.ui.renderList(Posts, {
      render: function (post) {
        var cls = Session.equals("selected_post", post._id) ?
          "selected" : "";
        return $("<div class='" + cls + "'>" + post.title + "</div>");
      }, events: {
        'click': function () {
          Session.set("selected_post", this._id);
        }
      }
    });

    document.body.appendChild(frag);

    // In this code, when the user clicks on an item to select it, the
    // render function is called twice: once to rerender the item
    // that lost the selection, and once to rerender the item that gained
    // the selection.
    //
    // If Session.get had been used instead of Session.equals, then when
    // the user clicked on an item, the render function would have to
    // called once for every Post shown in the list.

<h2 id="meteorui"><span>Meteor.ui</span></h2>

These are some utility functions for building interfaces. They make it
easy to create DOM elements that update automatically as data changes in
[`Session`](#pkg_session) variables or in a
[`Meteor.Collection`](#pkg_minimongo).

These helpers are implemented entirely on top of the public
interfaces at [`Meteor.deps`](#pkg_deps) and
[`Meteor.Collection`](#pkg_minimongo).

{{> api_box render}}

You provide a function that returns some DOM
elements. `Meteor.ui.render` gives you back some DOM elements that
automatically updates themselves in place. They are sensitive to changes
to session variables ([`Session.get`](#pkg_session_get) and to
database writes
([<code><i>collection</i>.update</code>](#pkg_minimongo_update), etc.)

The auto-updating elements are returned as a `DocumentFragment`. Simply
insert this `DocumentFragment` anywhere in the DOM you like. Its
elements will update themselves automatically until they are taken
offscreen &mdash; specifically, until [`Meteor.flush`](#flush) is called
when the elements are not children of `document`.

`events` lets you quickly hook up some event handlers to
the DOM nodes. If you provide `event_data`, it will be
passed to event handlers in `this`.

`Meteor.ui.render` may be called recursively (that
is, `render_func` can call `Meteor.ui.render`.) If
that happens, each invocation of `render` works
independently &mdash; an change to a dependency of the
inner `render_func` will (correctly) not cause the
outer `render_func` to be recomputed.

Example:

    // Show the number of users online.
    var frag = Meteor.ui.render(function () {
      return $("<p>There are " + Users.find({online: true}).length +
        " users online.</p>");
    });
    document.body.appendChild(frag);

    // Find all users that have been idle for a while, and mark them as
    // offline. The count on the screen will automatically update.
    Users.update({idleTime: {$gt: 30}}, {online: false});

    // Show a counter, and let the user click to increase or decrease it.
    Session.set("counter", 0);
    var frag = Meteor.ui.render(function () {
      return $('<div>Counter: ' + Session.get("counter") + ' ' +
        '<span class="inc">Increase</span>' +
        '<span class="dec">Decrease</span></div>');
      }, {
        'click .inc': function (event) {
          Session.set("counter", Session.get("counter") + 1);
      },
        'click .dec': function (event) {
          Session.set("counter", Session.get("counter") - 1);
      }
    });
    document.body.appendChild(frag);

{{> api_box renderList}}

This is [`Meteor.ui.render`](#render) crossed
with [<code><i>collection</i>.find().observe()</code>](#observe).
It calls a render function repeatedly for each document in a
collection that matches a query.

If you attach event handlers, then when they are triggered, they
will receive the document in `this`.

Returns a `DocumentFragment` with the same semantics as in
[`Meteor.ui.render`](#render) &mdash; insert it
anywhere, it will automatically update itself, make sure it's on the
page before the next time you
call [`Meteor.flush`](#flush).

Example:

    // List the titles of all of the posts that have the tag
    // "frontpage". Keep the list updated as new posts are made, as tags
    // change, etc. Let the user click a post to select it.
    Session.set("selected", null);
    var frag = Meteor.ui.renderList(Posts, {
      render: function (post) {
        var style = Session.equals("selected", post._id) ? "selected" : "";
        // A real app would need to quote/sanitize post._name
        return $('<div class="' + style + '">' + post._name + '</div>');
      },
      selector: {tags: "frontpage"},
      events: {
        'click': function (event) {
          Session.set("selected", this._id);
        }
      }
    });
    document.body.appendChild(frag);

{{#api_box_inline eventmaps}}

Several functions take event maps. An event map is an object where
the properties specify a set of events to handle, and the values are
the handlers for those events. The property can be in one of several
forms:

<dl>
{{#dtdd "<em>eventname</em>"}}
Matches a particular type of event, such as 'click'
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "<em>eventname selector</em>"}}
Matches a particular type of event, but only when it appears on
an element that matches a certain CSS selector
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "<em>event1, event2</em>"}}
To handle more than one type of event with the same function, use a comma-separated list.{{/dtdd}}

</dl>

The handler function gets one argument, an object with information
about the event. It will receive some additional context data
in `this`, depending on the context (eg: with
[`Meteor.ui.renderList`](#renderList), you get the
document; with a Handlebars template, you get the data being used to
fill the template.)

{{#warning}}
Right now, the event handlers are wired up with jQuery, and the event
object you receive is a jQuery event object. We would like to change
this so that you are not required to use jQuery.
{{/warning}}

{{#warning}}
There are currently two bugs that will cause events to not get
delivered in certain circumstances. Both have easy workarounds:

* If an event is filtered by a selector, then it will never be
delivered to a top-level node in a template. The problem is that
selectors will never match the top-level node in a template. This
matches other libraries but can be counterintuitive. The workaround is
to remove the selector if possible, or else add a wrapper element at the
top of the template.

* If a template A inserts another template B at the top-level of the
template, then if B updates itself, it will no longer receive
events. The workaround is to add a wrapper element around B.

{{/warning}}

Example:

    {
      // Fires when any element is clicked
      'click': function (event) { ... },

      // Fires when any element with the 'accept' class is clicked
      'click .accept': function (event) { ... },

      // Fires when 'accept' is clicked, or a key is pressed
      'keydown, click .accept': function (event) { ... }
    }

{{/api_box_inline}}

<h2 id="meteordeps"><span>Meteor.deps</span></h2>

Meteor has a simple dependency tracking system, so that it it can
automatically rerender templates and such when [`Session`](#session)
variables are modified, or database queries change.

Unlike most other systems, you don't have to manually declare these
dependencies &mdash; it "just works". The mechanism is simple and
efficient. When you call a function that supports reactive updates
(say, a database query), it automatically saves the current
"invalidation context" object if any (say, the current template being
rendered.) Later, when the data changes, it can "invalidates" this
context (tell the template to rerender itself.) The whole
implementation is about 50 lines of code.

Developers, particularly package authors, can use *invalidation
contexts* to implement additional reactive data sources or to write
functions that automatically register dependencies on reactive data
sources.

{{> api_box Context }}

Create an invalidation context by calling this constructor, then run
some code inside the context with [`run`](#run). Finally, register a
callback with [`on_invalidate`](#on_invalidate) that will get called
when the code you run wants to signal that it should be rerun.

Code can see if it's running inside an invalidation context by reading
the [`Meteor.deps.Context.current`](#current) global variable, which
will be the currently active context, or `null` if it's not being run
from inside a context.  If it wants to participate in the reactivity
system, it should save this context away, and later call the
[`invalidate`](#invalidate) method on the context when it wants to
signal that something has changed. If it does this, it should also use
[`on_invalidate`](#on_invalidate) to set up a cleanup function so that
it can know when to stop listening for changes.

Invalidation contexts have an attribute `id` which is a unique positive
integer. You're free to add any other attributes you like to the
invalidation context for your own convenience, as long as they don't
start with an underscore.

{{> api_box current }}

This is a global variable that is set by [`run`](#run).

If you have a background in Lisp or programming language theory, you
might think of it as a dynamically scoped ("special") variable. (That
just means that [`run`](#run) sets it, runs some user-supplied code, and
then restores its previous value.)

{{> api_box run }}

This function simply sets [`Meteor.deps.Context.current`](#current) to
this invalidation context, runs `func`, and then restores it to its
previous value. It returns the result of calling `func`.

It's fine for `run` to be called recursively. `current` will return the
innermost context.

{{> api_box on_invalidate }}

If this context hasn't been invalidated yet, adds `callback` to the list
of callbacks that will be called when [`invalidate`](#invalidate) is
called. If the context has already been invalidated, call `callback`
immediately.

Typically this function will have two kinds of callers:

* The function that creates the invalidation context will use the
  `on_invalidate` callback as a signal to rerun the code in the context,
  to see what new value it returns. In order to rerun the code, it'll
  create a fresh invalidation context and reregister its `on_invalidate`
  callback on that new context. When that context is invalidated the
  cycle will repeat.

* Functions that are sources of reactive data will save
  [`Meteor.deps.Context.current`](#current) into some kind of list of
  listeners. They'll use the `on_invalidate` callback to remove the
  context from their listener list.

Example:

    // Print the current username to the console.  Will re-run every time
    // the username changes.
    var log_current_username = function () {
      var update = function () {
        var ctx = new Meteor.deps.Context();  // invalidation context
        ctx.on_invalidate(update);         // rerun update() on invalidation
        ctx.run(function () {
          var username = Session.get("username");
          console.log("The current username is now", username);
        });
      };
      update();
    };

    // Example use. Since Session is reactive (meaning that it knows how
    // to use Meteor.deps to record its dependencies), log_current_username
    // will be re-run whenever Session.set is called for "username".
    Session.set("username", "matt");
    log_current_username(); // prints matt
    Session.set("username", "geoff"); // immediately prints geoff
    Session.set("username", "geoff"); // won't print: Session won't trigger
                                      // invalidation if the value is the same.

{{> api_box invalidate }}

If this function has already been called on this context, it does
nothing (a mathematician would say that it is "idempotent.") Otherwise
it calls each [`on_invalidate`](#on_invalidate) function registered on
the context.

The functions aren't called immediately &mdash; instead, they will be
called the next time you call [`Meteor.flush`](#flush). This function
just adds the context to the flush list and is guaranteed to do nothing
else just yet.

If you don't call [`Meteor.flush`](#flush) explicitly, it will be called
for you automatically when your code is done running (by setting a
`setTimeout` timer with a delay of zero.)

Example:

    // Create a simple class called Weather that tracks the current
    // temperature. The temperature can be read reactively.
    var Weather = function () {
      this.temperature = 60;
      this.listeners = {};
    };

    // Function to get the temperature (and, if called in a reactive
    // context, start listening for changes to the temperature.)
    Weather.prototype.get_temp = function () {
      var context = Meteor.deps.Context.current;

      // If we're inside a context, and it's not yet listening to
      // temperature changes..
      if (context && !this.listeners[context.id])
        // .. add it to our list of contexts that care about the temperature ..
        this.listeners[context.id] = context;

        // .. and remember to take it off our list when it goes away.
        var self = this;
        context.on_invalidate(function () {
          delete self.listeners[context.id];
        });
      }

      // return the current temperature, whether or not in a reactive context.
      return this.temperature;
    };

    // Function to set the temperature, and notify anyone that might be
    // listening for temperature updates.
    Weather.prototype.set_temp = function (new_temp) {
      if (this.temperature === new_temp)
        return; // don't want to trigger invalidation if there's no change.

      // Set the temperature
      this.temperature = new_temp;

      // Notify any contexts that care about temperature changes
      for (var context_id in this.listeners)
        // This will trigger the on_invalidate function above, but not
        // immediately -- only when Meteor.flush() is called, or at the end
        // of the event loop. So we know that this.listeners will be
        // emptied, but it won't change while we're trying to loop over it.
        this.listeners[context_id].invalidate();
    };
