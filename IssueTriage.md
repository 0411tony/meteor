## Issue lifecycle

We use Github [issues](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues) to track bugs and feature requests. The following chart illustrates the process we use to triage an issue. The goal is to end up with bugs and feature requests
that are well specced and un-ambigous - ready for contributors to begin working on.

[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/meteor) and our [forums](https://forums.meteor.com/c/help) are the place to ask for help on using the framework. Close issues that are help requests and politely refer the author to the above locations.
