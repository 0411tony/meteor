title: Migrating to Meteor 2.4
description: How to migrate your application to Meteor 2.4.

Most of the new features in Meteor 2.4 are either applied directly behind the scenes (in a backwards compatible manner) or are opt-in. For a complete breakdown of the changes, please refer to the [changelog](http://docs.meteor.com/changelog.html).

The above being said, there are a few items that you should implement to have easier time in the future.

<h3 id="createIndex">createIndex</h3>

Previously undocumented `_ensureIndex` has been aligned with MongoDB breaking change in naming and is now usable as `createIndex`. Use of `_ensureIndex` is now deprecated and will throw a warning in development for you.

<h3 id="email22">Email 2.2</h3>

The `email` package had a feature update. You can now override the sending functionality completely with `Email.customTransport` or if you are using [known services](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/well-known/) you can now ditch the `MAIL_URL` environment variable and set it in your `settings.json` file, like so:
```json
{
  "packages": {
    "email": {
      "service": "Mailgun",
      "user": "postmaster@meteor.com",
      "password": "superDuperPassword"
    }
  }
}
```

<h2 id="older-versions">Migrating from a version older than 2.3?</h2>
