Welcome to the Meteor guide.

This is a set of articles outlining opinions on best-practice application development in the [Meteor](https://meteor.com) framework. Our aim is that the set of articles detailed here covers patterns that are common to the development of all modern web and mobile applications. In this sense a lot of what's documented here is not necessarily Meteor specific and could be equally be applied to any application built with a focus on modern, reactive user interfaces.

Nothing in the Meteor guide is *required* to build a Meteor application (i.e. you can certainly use the platform in ways that contradict the principles and patterns of the guide). However, the guide is an attempt to document what we consider are best practices for app development. The guide is also an effort to document community conventions, and so we expect that in the future the practices documented here will generally be followed by the majority of the Meteor community.

To learn about "pure" Meteor, you can The APIs of the Meteor platform are available a the [docs site](https://docs.meteor.com), and you can browse community packages on [atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com).

The guide is intended as an intermediate document, aimed at those with some familiarity with the Meteor platform and web development in general. If you are just getting started with Meteor, we recommend beginning with the official tutorial[https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app].

  3. Hard APIs can be found at [docs] and community packages at [atmosphere].

2. What is Meteor?
  1. A set of JS client + server code for building web and mobile applications, built and curated by MDG and the Meteor community.
  2. A build tool for building JS bundles for deployment
3. Meteor principles
  1. Data on the Wire. Meteor doesn't send HTML over the network. The server sends data and lets the client render it.
  1. One Language. Meteor lets you write both the client and the server parts of your application in JavaScript.
  1. Database Everywhere. Query data on the client using the same syntax you use on the server.
  1. Optimistic UI. On the client, Meteor prefetches data and simulates models to make it look like server method calls return instantly.
  1. Full Stack Reactivity. In Meteor, realtime is the default. All layers, from database to template, update themselves automatically when necessary.
  1. Embrace the Ecosystem. Meteor is open source and integrates with existing open source tools and frameworks, with a strong ecosystem of community packages.
  1. Simplicity Equals Productivity. The best way to make something seem simple is to have it actually be simple. Meteor's main functionality has clean, classically beautiful APIs.
4. Guide concepts
  1. Developed in the open, PRs encouraged
  2. Consensus is sought but opinions must be taken; other choices are available!
  3. The guide "guides" the development of the platform and so is released alongside
5. Learning more
