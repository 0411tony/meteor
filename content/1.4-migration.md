<h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h2>

<h3 id="binary-packages-require-build-toolchain">Binary Packages require a Build Toolchain</h3>

The headline feature of Meteor 1.4 is the upgrade to Node version 4.4.7. Node 4 includes a changed ABI (application binary interface), which means that *binary npm packages* that your application uses will need to be recompiled.

Some very common binary packages will already have been republished for the Node 4 platform, so if you are using a limited set of packages, this may not affect you; however if you are using less common dependencies, this may be an issue.

The good news is that Meteor will recompile your binary dependencies for you when you first start your application after updating to 1.4 [@ben is this true? What about binary deps in `node_modules`?]. In order to do this, you will need a build toolchain on your development machine.

What this means is:

 - OS X users should install the [commandline tools](http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html) (in short, run `xcode-select --install`).

 - Windows users should install the [MS Build Tools](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159)

 - Linux users should ensure they have Python 2.7, `make` and a C compiler installed.

<h3 id="update-from-mongo-2_4">Update from MongoDB 2.4</h3>

Meteor has been updated to use version 2.2.4 of the node MongoDB driver. This means Meteor now ships with full support for MongoDB 3.2 (the latest stable version) and the WiredTiger storage engine. [We recommend](#update-to-mongo-3_2) you update your application to MongoDB 3.2.

If you are currently using MongoDB 2.4, please note that the version has reached [end-of-life](https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy) and you should at the least update to version 2.6. Version 2.6 is the minimum version supported by Meteor 1.4.

Updating your database to 2.6 is generally pretty painless. Please consult the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/2.6-upgrade/) for details about how to do so.

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

<h3 id="update-to-mongo-3_2">Update to MongoDB 3.2</h3>

Although Meteor 1.4 supports MongoDB 2.6 and up, as well as the older MMAPv1 storage engine, we recommend you update your database to use the new WiredTiger storage engine and use MongoDB 3.2.

To update your production database to version 3.2 you should follow the steps listed in the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.2-upgrade/). To update your storage engine, you should ensure you follow the ["Change Storage Engine to WiredTiger"](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/release-notes/3.0-upgrade/#change-storage-engine-to-wiredtiger) instructions in the 3.0 upgrade documentation.

You can update your development database in a similar way (if you are running `meteor` as usual, you can connect to the development database at `localhost:3001/meteor`). However, if you are not concerned about the data in your development database, the easiest thing to do is to remove it with `meteor reset`--when you next start `meteor`, it will be re-created with a 3.2 WiredTiger engine.

<h3 id="nested-imports">Use Nested Imports</h3>

Thanks to the use of the [reify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reify) library, Meteor now fully supports nested import statements:

```js
if (Meteor.isClient) {
  import { symbol } from './client-only/file';
}
```

One place this is particularly useful is in [test files that are only intended to run on the client or the server](https://github.com/meteor/todos/commit/3963a65d96cd7ef235a95d5e3a331d6f0606f70f)---you can now place them where appropriate; you are not forced to place them in a `client` or `server` directory.
