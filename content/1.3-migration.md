title: Migrating to 1.3
order: 20
description: How to migrate your application to use recommended best practice as of Meteor 1.3.
---

**NOTE**: this document is a work in progress and is not final. We aim to keep it up to date with the latest beta of the 1.3 release, which as of this writing is `1.3-beta.11`.

To update your app to this beta, type `meteor update --release 1.3-beta.11`.

Note in particular that many links below point to unfinished guide articles.

<h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h2>

 - Files in a directory named `imports/` will no longer load eagerly.

<h2 id="modules">Recommended changes: use modules</h2>

The biggest new feature in Meteor 1.3 is support for [ES2015 modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/import) on the client and the server. Using modules you can declare dependencies between files, control load order, and use NPM packages on the client and server easily.

You should load all Meteor "psuedo-globals" using the `import { Name } from 'meteor/package' syntax. For instance:

```js
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import { EJSON } from 'meteor/ejson';
```

If you are using app-local packages to control load order and write unit tests for your application, we recommend you switch to using modules. You can read about our recommended structure for applications and modules in the [Application Structure article](https://github.com/meteor/guide/blob/structure-content/content/structure.md) of the Meteor Guide, and how to test them in the [Testing article](https://github.com/meteor/guide/blob/testing-modules-content/content/testing.md).

If you are using Atmosphere packages which simply wrap NPM packages, both on the client and server, it is now recommended that you simply install them using NPM. Run `npm init` to initialize your `package.json` and install packages with `npm install --save` (or `npm install --save-dev` if it's development dependency for testing etc.). We have [some tips](https://github.com/meteor/guide/blob/package-content/content/packages.md#converting-between-callbacks-and-fibers) about how to use NPM packages written in an asyncronous style.

Also, you should no longer need to use the [`meteorhacks:npm`](https://atmospherejs.com/meteorhacks/npm) package.

<h2 id="packages">Recommended changes: package authors</h2>

Package authors are recommended to:

  - No longer publish wrapper packages that do no more than include an NPM package / client side lib. If your package adds significant wrappers around the NPM package, it might make sense however.

  - Publish to NPM when appropriate, especially if your package can be used by the wider JS community!

  - Use [`api.mainModule()`](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/release-1.3/packages/modules/README.md#modular-package-structure) and `export` from your main module rather than `api.exports()` in Atmosphere packages.

  - If you depend (directly or transitively) on a client side NPM package that is large or problematic if installed twice (e.g. React), use [`tmeasday:check-npm-versions`](https://github.com/tmeasday/check-npm-versions) (XXX: not yet published) to declare "peer" dependencies.

<h2 id="testing">Recommended changes: Testing</h2>

Meteor 1.3 includes a new command `meteor test-app`, which can be used to run tests against your app, in two modalities. You can read about these features in much more detail in the [Testing Guide Article](https://github.com/meteor/guide/blob/testing-modules-content/content/testing.md).

<h3 id="integration-testing">Integration testing</h3>

If you were previously using [Velocity](http://velocity.meteor.com) to run tests against your running Meteor app, the integration test mode should allow you to run your tests against 1.3, with some small changes.

To convert tests, you'll need to change or upgrade your test driver package to a 1.3 conformant package (as of this writing there is only one choice [`avital:mocha`](https://atmospherejs.com/avital/mocha) but we expect this to change very soon). In your tests you should check that `Meteor.isIntegrationTest` is `true` and start your tests by running meteor test-app --integration`.

<h3 id="unit-testing">Unit testing</h3>

If you were previously using in-app packages in order to unit test your app, you should switch to a [modules-based approach](#modules) and test them using the unit test mode.

To convert your unit tests to run against the app, first upgrade your test driver (see [above](#integration-testing)) and then place your test files alongside the modules they are testing with a name matching `*.tests.*`. Such files will automatically be added to your "unit test app" when you run `meteor test-app --unit`. You can check `Meteor.isUnitTest` to differentiate such tests from integration tests, and `import` the modules that you need to test against within each test file.

<h2 id="mobile">Recommended changes: Mobile</h2>

**NOTE**: please disregard the below for now.

## Migrating to use imports everywhere

Never use a symbol without importing it (i.e. no more psuedo-globals!).

In general from core Meteor libraries your code should remain unchanged, and you just add some lines like:

```js
import {Meteor} from 'meteor/meteor';
import {ReactiveVar} from 'meteor/reactive-var';
```

With the following exceptions


1. Use `import {Collection, Cursor, ObjectID} from 'meteor/mongo'`

2. Use `import {MeteorServer} from 'meteor/ddp-server'` and call:
  1. `MeteorServer.publish()`
  2. `MeteorServer.methods()`

3. Use `import {MeteorConnection} from 'meteor/ddp-client'` and call:
  1. `MeteorConnection.apply()`
  1. `MeteorConnection.call()`
  1. `MeteorConnection.disconnect()`
  1. `MeteorConnection.onConnection()`
  1. `MeteorConnection.reconnect()`
  1. `MeteorConnection.status()`
  1. `MeteorConnection.subscribe()`

4. Use `import {connect} from 'meteor/ddp-client'` rather than `DDP.connect`;

5. Use `import {Accounts} from 'meteor/accounts-base'` and (on the client) use:
  1. `Accounts.user()` instead of `Meteor.currentUser()`
  2. `Accounts.userId()` instead of `Meteor.userId()`,
  3. `Accounts.loggingIn()` insead of `Meteor.loggingIn()`,
  4. `Accounts.logout()` instead of `Meteor.logout()`,
  5. `Accounts.logoutOtherClients()` instead of `Meteor.logoutOtherClient()`
  6. `Accounts.users` instead of `Meteor.users`
  
6. Use `import {AccountsPassword} from 'meteor/accounts-password'` and:
  1. On the client, call:
    1. `AccountsPassword.loginWithPassword()` instead of `Meteor.loginWithPassword()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.changePassword()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.createUser()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.forgotPassword()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.resetPassword()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.verifyEmai()`
  2. On the server, call:
    1. `AccountsPassword.findUserByEmail()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.findUserByUsername()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.onEmailVerificationLink()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.onEnrollmentLink()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.onResetPasswordLink()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.addEmail()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.removeEmail()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.sendEnrollmentEmail()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.sendResetPasswordEmail()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.sendVerificationEmail()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.setPassword()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.setUsername()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.createUser()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.emailTemplate()`

7. Use `import {AccountsFacebook} from 'meteor/accounts-facebook'` and:
  1. `AccountsFacebook.loginWithFacebook()` rather than `Meteor.loginWithFacebook()`.

  XXX: not yet changed on the branch, in lieu of bikeshedding

8. Use `import {Template} from 'meteor/templating'` (gotcha)

9. Use `import {config} from 'meteor/accounts-ui-unstyled'`

10. Use `import {Computation, Dependency} from 'meteor/tracker'`
