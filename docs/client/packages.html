<h1 id="packagelist">Packages</h1>

Meteor supports a variety of add-on packages and third party
libraries. While you can build great applications using only the
Meteor core functionality, optional packages can make development even
faster and better.

Packages can be added and removed from a Meteor project with:

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ meteor add <i>package_name</i>
</pre>

and removed with:

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ meteor remove <i>package_name</i>
</pre>


## `amplify`

Amplify provides a simple cross-browser API for HTML5 local storage, an
in-browser communication channel for loosely coupling application
components, and several useful utility functions.

Amplify defines a global namespace `amplify` on the client only. It does
not run on the server.

For more information about Amplify, see <a href="http://amplifyjs.com/">http://amplifyjs.com/</a>

## `backbone`

Backbone is a popular client-side MVC framework for managing complex
data in the browser. In addition to the MVC and DOM-binding
functionality, it also provides an API for HTML5 pushState and
client-side URL routing.

For more information about Backbone, see
<a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/</a>

<div class='warning'>
Tighter integration between Backbone models and Meteor data is coming
soon, along with additional examples and patterns for using Backbone
with Meteor.

## `coffeescript`

CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. It
provides a simple syntax without lots of braces and parentheses.  The
code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no
interpretation at runtime.

CoffeeScript is supported on both the client and the server. Files
ending with `.coffee` are automatically compiled to JavaScript.

See <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/</a>
for more information.

## `jquery`

<a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is a fast and concise JavaScript
Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling,
animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.

The `jquery` package adds the jQuery library to the client JavaScript
bundle. It has no effect on the server.

In addition to the `jquery` package, Meteor provides several jQuery
plugins as separate packages. These include:

* `jquery-history`
* `jquery-layout`
* `jquery-waypoints`

## `less`

LESS extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins,
operations and functions. It allows for more compact stylesheets and
helps reduce code duplication in CSS files.

With the `less` package installed, `.less` files in your application are
automatically compiled to CSS and the results are included in the client
CSS bundle.

See <a href="http://lesscss.org/">http://lesscss.org/</a> for
documentation of the LESS language.

## `showdown`
<!-- XXX rename to markdown when we rename the package -->

This package lets you use Markdown in your templates. It's easy: just
put your markdown inside
<code>{&#123;#markdown}}</code> ... <code>{&#123;/markdown}}</code>
tags. You can still use all of the usual Meteor template features
inside a Markdown block, such `#each`, and you still get reactivity.

<!-- XXX include an example -->

## `underscore`

Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides
support for functional programming. It is invaluable for writing clear,
concise JavaScript in a functional style.

The `underscore` package defines the `_` namespace on both the client
and the server.

See <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/">http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/</a>
for underscore API documentation.

<div class='warning'>
Currently, underscore is included in all projects, as the Meteor
core depends on it. _ is available in the global namespace on both the
client and the server even if you do not include this package. However
if you do use underscore in your application, you should still add the
package as we will remove the default underscore in the future.
