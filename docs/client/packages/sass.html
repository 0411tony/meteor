## `sass`

Sass is a CSS pre-processor with a minimal syntax and powerful dynamic
expresions. With the `sass` package installed, `.sass` files in your
application are automatically compiled to CSS and the results are
included in the client CSS bundle.

See <https://github.com/visionmedia/sass.js> for the JavaScript implementation
of the Sass language and <http://sass-lang.com/> for the original project.
