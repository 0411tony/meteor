## `spiderable`

The `spiderable` package makes an application crawlable by web
spiders. It uses the <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/">AJAX Crawling specification</a> published by Google
to serve pre-rendered HTML to web spiders that follow the protocol
(Google, Bing, Yandex, and more).

In order to have links between multiple pages on a site visible to
spiders, apps must use real links (eg `<a href="/about">`) rather than
simply re-rendering portions of the page when an element is
clicked. Apps should render their content based on the URL of the page
and can use HTML5 push-state to alter the URL on the client without
triggering a page reload. See the <a href="http://meteor.com">Todos
example</a> for a demonstration.

{{#warning}}
The current implementation of the spiderable package is
inefficient and is meant as an temporary solution. Expect significant
changes to this package.

{{#warning}}
If you deploy your application with `meteor bundle`, you must install
`phantomjs` (<a href="http://phantomjs.org/">http://phantomjs.org</a>)
somewhere in your `$PATH`. If you use `meteor deploy` this is already
taken care of.
