## `fastclick`

The FastClick package is automatically included in Meteor Cordova/PhoneGap
apps to ensure the best user experience.

From the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick):

> FastClick is a simple, easy-to-use library for eliminating the 300ms delay
between a physical tap and the firing of a click event on mobile browsers.
The aim is to make your application feel less laggy and more responsive while
avoiding any interference with your current logic.
