# ddp

DDP is the stateful websocket protocol that Meteor uses to communicate between the client and the server. This package is used internally by almost every Meteor app.

You can use it directly by calling [`DDP.connect`](http://docs.meteor.com/#ddp_connect) to connect to any DDP server.

See the project page on DDP for more details. XXX link
