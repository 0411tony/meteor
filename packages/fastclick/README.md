# fastclick

FastClick is a simple, easy-to-use library for eliminating the 300ms delay
between a physical tap and the firing of a `click` event on mobile browsers. The
aim is to make your application feel less laggy and more responsive while
avoiding any interference with your current logic.

FastClick is developed by [FT Labs](http://labs.ft.com/), part of the Financial
Times.

For more info see the original repo:
[ftlabs/fastclick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick).


This package is included by default on all Meteor Phonegap/Cordova apps and can
be added as a direct dependency of your application if fastclick is desired on
the mobile web app, too.
